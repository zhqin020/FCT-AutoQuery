# Specification Quality Checklist: Save JSON Files & Batch Scrape Optimization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-25
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [ ] Edge cases are identified
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Notes

- Validation performed 2025-11-25: all checklist items pass for initial spec.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were necessary. If new constraints arise (retention policy, external integrations), add clarifications then revalidate.
