Project Constitution — Workspace-level preferences

1) Numbered next-step options rule:
   - When I present multiple suggested next actions or choices to you, I will prefix each option with a number (1., 2., 3., ...).
   - You can reply with the number to choose that option.

   - 示例（Example）:
     1. Run the scraper and attach JSON output
     2. Commit and push the branch
     3. Replace `id` with `doc_id` in exported JSON

2) Assistant behavior note:
   - I (the assistant) cannot change any system-level or platform 'constitution' that controls assistant behavior, but I will honor and record this workspace-level preference in this file and adopt the numbered-options rule in our interaction.

3) Localization:
   - The rule above is presented in English and Chinese to help bilingual collaboration.

(Added by the assistant for workspace preference; not a replacement for system policies.)
