# FCT-AutoQuery Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Environment Activation
Before starting console or running commands, the environment must be activated: conda activate fct

### II. Issue Tracking
Upon completion of problem resolution, record and summarize in the issues directory, update the issue file, and continue resolution until the status is CLOSED

### III. Logging
Project logs are located in the logs directory, with the latest log file being: logs/scraper-1.log

### IV. Testing
Test files must only be stored in the tests directory, named as test_*.py

## Additional Constraints

[SECTION_2_CONTENT]

## Development Workflow

[SECTION_3_CONTENT]

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan

All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Original adoption date unknown | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-06
